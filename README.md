# Flight-Operations-Maintenance-Optimization
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting flight delays using real-world flight data from U.S. domestic airlines. The aim is to explore delay patterns, uncover correlations, and build a simple predictive model based on departure delays.
# Objective
Identify key trends and delay patterns based on hour, month, and airline

Explore the relationship between departure and arrival delays

Build a Linear Regression model to estimate arrival delay based on departure delay

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Dataset: flights.csv (1 year of domestic flight records from the U.S.)

Jupyter Notebook / Thonny (local execution)

# Key Insights
Strong correlation (0.91) between departure and arrival delays

Peak delays occur during late afternoon and early evening

Airlines show variation in average delay times — some carriers are consistently more punctual

# Model Summary
Model: Linear Regression

Input: Departure delay (dep_delay)

Output: Predicted arrival delay (arr_delay)

# Regression Results:
🔹 Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 13.13 minutes

🔹 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 18.07 minutes

🔹 R² Score: 0.83
